My term project is a Mathematical Software (basically a fancy calculator),
that I wrote from scratch (well actually from the 112 event.example0.py 
barebones file with inspiration from the 112 mode demo), importing only
Tkinter, math, and copy. It has high-computation matrix algebra capabilities,
such as:
	-matrix multiplication
	-gaussian elimination
	-computing determinants
	-finding inverses
	-solving linear systems
	-LU factorization
My project also has Statistical and Graphing capabilities, including
one-variable stats (EDA and boxplots), two-variable stats (scatterplots
and linear regression), graphing real functions of one variable, and 
visualizing linear transformations in the xy-plane.

If you have Sublime and Python 2/3 already installed, you can copy&paste
my code and run it to use my software. If you only have pyzo, minor modifications
can be made to use my code: just change "Tkinter" to "tkinter" and remove the "future"
statements at the beginning of the code.
